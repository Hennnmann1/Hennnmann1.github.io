    	<!-- Blurb about myself here -->
    	I am a Cleveland, Ohio native who originally came to NYC to study music. 
    	I play 5 instruments and have studied privately. I finished up my Collegiate studies at CCNY because of the stronger, traditional Liberal Arts curriculm. I have also studied at Jazzmobile. Presently, I work as a Mail Machine operator and Clerical for the City of NY in Civil Service. And a member of Bronx Community Board 3.
